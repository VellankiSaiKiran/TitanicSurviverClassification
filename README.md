# Titanic Survival Classifier

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning models. It utilizes Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers to analyze the Titanic dataset, highlighting the importance of different features in predicting survival.

## Project Structure

- **Data Loading**: The dataset is a combined version hosted on GitHub, originally from the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).
- **Data Cleaning and Exploration**: Initial steps to prepare the data for modeling, including handling missing values and exploring data distributions.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
- **Evaluation**: Comparing the performance of both models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
